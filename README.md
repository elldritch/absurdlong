# absurdlong

`absurdlong` computes the longest game of [Absurdle](https://qntm.org/absurdle) you could possibly play while still guessing rationally.

A rational player:

- Never reuses black letters.
- Always reuses green letters in the same position.
- Always reuses yellow letters, but never in a previously yellowed position.
